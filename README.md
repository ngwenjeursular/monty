# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
Monty is described as a scripting language that relies on a unique stack and is compiled into Monty byte codes.
We follow the betty style guideline

code will be compiled in the following manner:
"""$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty"""
